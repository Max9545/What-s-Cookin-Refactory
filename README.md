## Overview 

`Refactor Tractor - What's Cookin` is a group project for Module 2 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). We were tasked to implement new technologies to a pre-existing codebase we were unfamiliar with.  This recipe tracking/ meal planning application allows users to view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and add recipes to a 'cookbook' for later use. See the original project spec [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/whats-cookin.html).



### Goals

``` Markdown
* Navigate, refactor and build on the pre-existing code of someone else. 
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Use inheritance to DRY repetitive logic
* Ensure application follows best practices for accessibility
* Leverage Sass to DRY up CSS
* Incorporate Webpack to streamline workflow process


```
